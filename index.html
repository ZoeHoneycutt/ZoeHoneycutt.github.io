        <h3>Intrests</h3>

      <p> The earliest forms of books were long, rolled scrolls made from papyrus in ancient Egypt around 2400 BC.
    Papyrus scrolls were made by slicing the inner pith of the papyrus plant into thin strips,layering them in a horizontal crisscross pattern,
    pressing them together until the plant's natural sap acted as glue, and drying them into sheets, then were burnished and glued together.
   </p>

   <p>Egyptians also wrote on mesotopian clay tablets, made from wet clay molded into manageable blocks. They then wrote inscribed with
    wedge-shaped marks (also known as Cuneiform) using a reed stylus; they were dried in the sun or fired in kilns for longevity.
    Egyptians also developed new writing systems like Hieroglyphs (for monuments), and Hieratic (cursive writing for daily use), and 
    Demotic (complex cursive) beyond simple word signs for complex texts.</p>

    <p> They also invented black ink and reed pens. Black ink was invented using soot from burning organic materials like wood or oil with a binder,
      most commonly gum arabic from the acacia tree, and tree.The soot provided the black color, while the gum arabic helped the ink adhere to the surface and prevent it from clumping or fading.
      Recent studies have shown that some ancient black inks also contained copper, likely derived from the copper-rich ore used to create the soot, notes Sciworthy. Other elements like lead were sometimes added in later periods to help the ink adhere better, according to the Smithsonian Magazine.</p>

      <p>Papyrus scrolls evolved into modern books through a key shift to the codex format (bound pages), replacing scrolls for better navigation; then, the invention of paper (from China) and the Gutenberg printing press (movable type) drastically sped up production, lowered costs, and increased literacy, paving the way for mass-produced, affordable books we know today
      The Gutenberg press was created by Johannes Gutenberg arounf 1450 by combining several innovations perfecting movable metal type (individual, reusable letters cast in molds), developing a durable oil-based ink, and adapting a screw press to press inked type onto paper, revolutionizing book production by making texts widely available and affordable.
      The typewriter was made through a series of mechanical and technological developments, beginning with inventors like Christopher Latham Sholes, who created the first commercially successful "Type-Writer" in collaboration with Samuel Soule and Carlos Glidden. Its construction involves key components like a keyboard, inked ribbon, and typebars, 
      which are then assembled with a system of springs, levers, and rollers. The process includes metalworking for individual parts, such as cutting rods into fasteners, and finishing treatments for durability and appearance.</p>

      <p>Modern Day books (evolvement from the ancient Egyptian Scrolls) are mass-produced through high-speed, automated processes starting with large digital files, printing thousands of pages on massive rolls of paper using offset or digital presses, then automatically folding, cutting, gluing, and casing them together with laminated covers, a far cry from Gutenberg's movable type but a direct descendant of its goal: affordable, rapid book creation.
        Modern books thrive in diverse formats, with print still dominating but e-books and audiobooks growing, while the industry sees millions of new titles annually, readers benefit from stress relief and focus, and classic literature remains foundational, proving books are more relevant than ever for entertainment, learning, and mental well-being.
        Books have also helped developed of people after general education increased over the years. Like the understanding of Psychology, Biology, how we can reduce stress and how to heal our bodies.
        A study revealed that percentages of mental health disorders and physical illness has went down after the production of Self help/self-improvement books.</p>

       <p> E-books were developed through the first amazon kindle, as a public publishing website were anyone could write articles, magazines, stories, etc.
        The first Amazon Kindle was made by Amazon's secret hardware division, Lab126, starting around 2004, led by Steve Kessel, evolving from ideas about e-readers and using Mobipocket's software, featuring a unique asymmetric design with a physical keyboard, E Ink screen, and built-in free 3G for Amazon's store, launching in late 2007 as a single-purpose device to light a fire for reading. 
       This mass production made the percentages of reading and children's educational scores skyrocket.</p>
